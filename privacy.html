    <h1>Privacy Policy for MarketPulse</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 25, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to MarketPulse (the "Application"), provided by Anaxares ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices concerning the information we collect and how we use it in connection with your use of the Application. Our contact email for privacy inquiries is <a href="mailto:jb-it@gmx.de">jb-it@gmx.de</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. Core Functionality and Permissions</h2>
    <p>MarketPulse presents live stock prices and news visually and audibly. To achieve its intended functionality and due to its technical architecture (based on default configurations for its development platform), the Application may operate with permissions that grant it broad access to system resources, such as those provided by the <code>runFullTrust</code> capability.</p>

    <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>a. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong><br>
    We want to assure our users that despite the permissions the Application may have, <strong>MarketPulse does not knowingly access, collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong>. PII includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, physical address, phone number, financial information, precise location, contacts, photos, documents, or any other data that could directly identify you. The Application does not require users to create accounts.</p>

    <p><strong>b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) / Technical Data</strong><br>
    To improve the Application's stability, understand feature popularity, and guide future development, MarketPulse collects the following types of anonymous, aggregated technical data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous Usage Statistics:</strong> This includes information about which features within the Application are used, session duration, and other interactions, all collected in a way that does not identify individual users.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymous Crash Reports and Diagnostics:</strong> If the Application encounters an error, it may collect anonymous diagnostic information and crash reports to help us identify and fix issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This technical data is strictly anonymous and aggregated and cannot be used to identify an individual user.</p>

    <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>As MarketPulse does not collect any PII, we do not use PII for any purpose.<br>
    The anonymous, aggregated technical data (as described in Section 3b) is used exclusively for the following internal purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To improve the stability and performance of the Application.</li>
        <li>To understand how users interact with different features, helping us to enhance user experience.</li>
        <li>To guide future development efforts and prioritize new features or improvements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share any PII with third parties, as we do not collect any.<br>
    The anonymous, aggregated technical data collected by MarketPulse is not shared with any external third parties. It is used solely by Anaxares for internal improvement purposes. The Application does not integrate third-party services that directly collect information from users through MarketPulse.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>The anonymous and aggregated technical data (usage statistics and crash reports) described in Section 3b is stored on secure Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure. Access to this data is restricted to Anaxares, and the data is maintained in an anonymized and aggregated form to protect user privacy. We rely on the security measures provided by our service provider (Microsoft Azure) to safeguard this data.</p>

    <h2>7. User Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>As MarketPulse does not collect Personally Identifiable Information, provisions for users to access, update, or delete their personal data are not applicable.<br>
    Currently, MarketPulse does not offer an option to opt-out of the collection of anonymous, aggregated technical data, as this data is vital for maintaining and improving the application for all users and is non-identifiable.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>MarketPulse is intended for individuals who are legally old enough to engage in stock trading and financial analysis. The Application is <strong>not intended for use by children</strong> (e.g., individuals under the age of 13, or a higher age if stipulated by local regulations for financial services or data consent).<br>
    We do not knowingly collect any personal information or any other data from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with information, or that we have inadvertently collected data from a child, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Significant changes may also be noted in the Application's update description in the Microsoft Store.</p>
